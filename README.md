## System Requirements

* [Ulauncher](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher) > 5.0
* [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) with [Caching](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/93022442-b49b-4510-b695-e10d8651ecfe.html) enabled (default).
* Python >= 3

## Install

Open ulauncher preferences window -> extensions -> add extension and paste the following url:

```
https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-dendron
```

## Usage

* By default this extension looks for `dendron` keyword. You can change it to something shorter like `dd` on the extension settings.

* Typing the keyword and then a query, it will filter all your notes matching that query in both title and hierarchy fields.

Before starting using this extension, you must set some settings to match your Dendron install. See section below.

:rotating_light: Dendron cache files are only updated on the initialization of the Dendron Workspace. This means new notes won¬¥t appear unless you reload your Dendron workspace.

### Open with quickmd

Select an item and press `ALT-Enter`

### Configuration

This extension requires the following settings to be set, according your Dendron install:
